# Finder_Abhi
Created a media searcher using the iTunes API. The user could select the media content type to search (only music, tvShow and movie) and should be able to filter with a search field. After search, a table view is displayed as follows:
Music – Artist Name, Track Name, Url and Image.
TV Show – Artist Name, Long Description, Url and Image.
Movie – Track Name, Long Description, Url and Image.
Additionally, if the user taps on the Image, show a bouncing animation for the picture only. Also, url will be played using AVKit & AVFoundation.
